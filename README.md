# Self_balancing_robot

This task required us to create MicroPython code that would be able to control the balance of a two-wheeled robot using PID control.
The self-balancing segway uses PID Control to dance to music, implementing routines to move to any song played.Â  
It is able to move and stand on its own, without any help, and can be controlled using BlueTooth connectivity.
